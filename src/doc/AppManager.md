# AppManager
The AppManager class is a specialized container for the Application. The container supports the following specialized operations:

1. Initialize all Applications.

   The initialization happens in the constructor. It receives a list of .desktop file paths divided into [ranks](#ranks). It then traverses the list from the lowest rank to the highest rank to avoid collisions (this is further described in [collisions](#collisions)).
2. Provide a (Generic)Name to `Application` (+ `is_generic`) mapping.

   The mapping isn't required to have any particular order. It is used in the process of creating a list of names for dmenu to display (see [Names](#names) for caveats) and for resolving the selected name to `Application`.

   This mapping also stores whether the name is generic or not. This is used in history management.

   1. The list of application names must not contain duplicates.

      Multiple different desktop files can have colliding names. For example many browsers have "Web Browser" set as their `GenericName`. Dmenu can not differentiate multiple entries which have the same text and the user can't too. This means that AppManager must handle colliding names. Note that this is not specified in the desktop entry specification.
3. Additional "runtime" addition and removal of a desktop file.

   This feature is used in the inotify/kqueue runtime detection of new desktop files. See [optimisation](#optimisation).

   An application that is already in AppManager can be also "added". This operation is equivalent to removing and adding the desktop file.
4. Lookup `Application` by its desktop file ID.

   The primary use of this feature is only for converting the old format of the history file to the new one. This operation will not be needed in a typical j4dd session. But it's useful to have AppManager optimised for it, because it is useful in implementation of runtime addition and removal of a desktop file.
5. Return the number of loaded desktop files.

   Due to collisions, not all desktop files supplied to the constructor can be loaded.

   This feature is used primarily for verbose output.
# Collisions
There are two main types of collisions:

1. Desktop file ID collisions:
   1. When two colliding desktop files have a different rank, the one with a lower rank takes precedence.
   2. When two colliding desktop files have the same rank, the behaviour is implementation defined. J4dd chooses to leave the desktop file already present be and it omits the newer colliding desktop file.

      Exception: To facilitate the overwriting nature of the runtime addition operation (described in 3.), a new colliding desktop file **will** overwrite the already present one even when they have the same rank (**not** when the newer one has a higher rank). This is true **only** for the runtime addition operation, not for the constructor.
2. Desktop name collisions:

   Note that desktop name collisions are universal, a `Name` can collide with a `Name` of some other desktop file, `Name` can collide with `GenericName` etc.

   1. When two colliding names belong to desktop files with different ranks, the name whose desktop file has the lower rank takes precedence.
   1. When two colliding names belong to desktop files with the same rank, name which is already in the list takes precedence. This means that the newer name won't get added.

When j4dd has the choice, it chooses the "lazy" approach to handling collisions. This means that when j4dd has to choose between an app that is already in place and a new app, the old app is chosen.

Desktop file ID collisions are mandated by the standard. Desktop name collisions are specific to j4dd.
# Ranks
The standard specifies the following handling of desktop file ID collisions:

> Each desktop entry representing an application is identified by its _desktop file ID_, which is based on its filename.
>
> [...]
>
> If multiple files have the same desktop file ID, the first one in the `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` precedence order is used.

This means that the "parent" directory of the desktop file is important for determining precedence.

J4dd uses a "rank" to store this precedence information. If the desktop file is found in the first (zeroth) directory in `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, it's rank is 0. If it's in the second directory in `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, it's rank is 1.

The lowest rank is 0. Lower ranks take precedence. The zeroth rank has the highest priority.

# Names
AppManager uses strictly "real" application names specified in the desktop file and in the `Application`. J4dd itself has to work with formatted names (with formatters from `Formatters.hh`). A conversion from name to formatted name and back is necessary, but that isn't AppManager's responsibility.

# Optimisation
J4dd should be optimised for operations which are the most critical for the user. These are initialising AppManager with desktop files and providing the name to `Application` mapping. The runtime addition and removal of desktop files is not the primary target for optimisation. In the current implementation, data structures and algorithms have been chosen according to this.

# History
History management is handled outside of AppManager.
