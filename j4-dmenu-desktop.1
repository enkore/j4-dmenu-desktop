.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op OPTIONS
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a faster replacement for i3-dmenu-desktop.
.Pp
It's purpose is to find .desktop files and offer you a menu to start an
application using dmenu.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b , Fl Fl display-binary
Display binary name after each entry (off by default).
.It Fl f , Fl Fl display-binary-base
Display basename of binary name after each entry (off by default).
.It Fl d , Fl Fl dmenu Ar command
Determines the command used to invoke dmenu.
Executed with your shell
.Pq Ev $SHELL
or
.Pa /bin/sh .
.It Fl Fl no-exec
Do not execute selected command, send to stdout instead.
.It Fl Fl no-generic
Do not include the generic name of desktop entries.
.It Fl t , Fl Fl term Ar command
Sets the terminal emulator used to start terminal apps.
.It Fl Fl usage-log Ar file
Must point to a read-writeable file (will create if not exists). In this mode
entries are sorted by usage frequency.
.It Fl Fl prune-bad-usage-log-entries
Remove names marked in usage log for which
.Nm
was unable to find a desktop file.
This can happen when an app marked in usage log no longer exists because it was
uninstalled.
.It Fl x , Fl Fl use-xdg-de
Enables reading
.Ev $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
to determine the desktop environment.
.It Fl Fl wait-on Ar path
Must point to a path where a file can be created.
In this mode no menu will be shown.
Instead the program waits for
.Ar path
to be written to
.Po
use
.Ql echo > path
.Pc .
Every time this happens a menu will be shown.
Desktop files are parsed ahead of time.
Performing
.Ql echo -n q > path
will exit the program.
.It Fl Fl wrapper Ar wrapper
A wrapper binary.
Useful in case you want to wrap into 'i3 exec'.
.It Fl I , Fl Fl i3-ipc
Execute desktop entries through i3 IPC.
Requires i3 to be running.
.It Fl Fl skip-i3-exec-check
Disable the check for
.Fl Fl wrapper Qq i3 exec .
j4-dmenu-desktop has direct support for i3 through the
.Fl I
flag which should be used instead of the
.Fl Fl wrapper
option. j4-dmenu-desktop detects this and exits.
This flag overrides this behaviour.
.It Fl i , Fl Fl case-insensitive
Sort applications case insensitively
.It Fl v
Be more verbose.
When specified once,
.Cm INFO
is used, when twice,
.Cm DEBUG
is used.

.Fl v .
This flag takes precedence over
.Fl v .
.It Fl Fl log-file Ar file

.It Fl h , Fl Fl help

.Ss LOG LEVELS

.Nm
uses the following log levels:

loglevels are displayed by default.
