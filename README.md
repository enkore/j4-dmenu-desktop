# j4-dmenu-desktop

j4-dmenu-desktop is a fast desktop menu using `dmenu` (or compatible programs).
It scans .desktop files in $XDG_DATA_HOME and $XDG_DATA_DIRS, providing a menu
for launching applications.

It is inspired by i3-dmenu-desktop. Like i3-dmenu-desktop, j4-dmenu-desktop
offers optional integration with i3wm (but j4-dmenu-desktop should work just
fine on about any desktop environment).

You can also execute shell commands using it.

## Features

- speed
- conformance to the [Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/1.5/)[^1]
- daemon mode with `--wait-on` which parses desktop files ahead of time
- support for history sorted by usage frequency using `--usage-log`
- automatic desktop file loading/removal in daemon mode using inotify/kqueue
- support for any dmenu-like program (j4-dmenu-desktop is independent of any
  desktop environment + it works with both Xorg and [Wayland](#examples))
- (optional) i3 IPC integration
- multiple formatters available (program name, program name with executable
  path...)
- completions for all major shells + a manpage
- and more!

and an active Void Linux user, I ensure a higher standard of quality for this
package. This package is officially supported, feel free to [open
issues](https://github.com/enkore/j4-dmenu-desktop/issues/new) or ask for
support related to the Void Linux package here.

## Examples

Run j4-dmenu-desktop:

    j4-dmenu-desktop

Specify custom dmenu (useful on Wayland, [tofi](https://github.com/philj56/tofi)
is used as example):

    j4-dmenu-desktop --dmenu=tofi

Display 5 entries vertically at once:

    j4-dmenu-desktop --dmenu="dmenu -l5"

display binary name alongside name (for example `Chromium` will become `Chromium
(/usr/bin/chromium)`):

    j4-dmenu-desktop --display-binary

Don't display generic names and use `alacritty` as terminal emulator:

    j4-dmenu-desktop --no-generic --term alacritty

## FAQ / RAQ / RMR

### I want it to display normal binaries, too, yes?

You can put this in a script file and use it instead of calling j4dd directly:

    j4-dmenu-desktop --dmenu="(cat ; (stest -flx $(echo $PATH | tr : ' ') | sort -u)) | dmenu"

Exchanging the `cat` and `(stest ... sort -u)` parts will swap the two parts (j4dd's output and the list of binaries).

### Get the output into a pipe / launching a program by arbitrary user input

### How much faster is it?

    % time i3-dmenu-desktop --dmenu="cat"
    [{"success":true}]
    i3-dmenu-desktop --dmenu="cat"  0.37s user 0.02s system 96% cpu 0.404 total
    % time ./j4-dmenu-desktop --dmenu=cat
    ./j4-dmenu-desktop --dmenu=cat  0.01s user 0.01s system 107% cpu 0.015 total

More than 25 times faster :)
