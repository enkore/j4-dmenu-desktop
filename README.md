# j4-dmenu-desktop

[![Travis Build](https://api.travis-ci.org/enkore/j4-dmenu-desktop.png)](https://travis-ci.org/enkore/j4-dmenu-desktop/)

j4-dmenu-desktop is a replacement for i3-dmenu-desktop. It's purpose
is to find .desktop files and offer you a menu to start an application
using dmenu. Since r2.7 j4-dmenu-desktop doesn't require i3wm anymore
and should work just fine on about any desktop environment.

You can also execute shell commands using it.

* Compiler with basic C++11 support (GCC 4.77 or later required, Clang works, too)
